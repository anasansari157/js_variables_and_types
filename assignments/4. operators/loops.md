1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;

for () {

}
// your code goes here
```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js

for (num = 0; num <= 20; num++) {
    if (num % 2 = 0) {
        alert(`${num} is even`);
    } 
    else {
        alert(`${num} is odd`);
    }
}
// your code goes here
```

3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
```js

for (num = 0; num <= 10; num++) {
    console.log(`${num} * 9 = ${num*9}`);
}
```

4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)

```js
for (num1 = 1; num1 <= 10; num1++) {
    for (num2 = 1; num2 <= 10; num2++) {
        console.log(`${num1} * ${num2} = ${num1*num2}`);
    }
}

```

5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
let string1 = "";
let string2 = "";
for(let num = 1; num <= 10; num++) {
    if(num < 5) {
        string1 += `${num}, `;
    }
    else if (num == 5) {
        string1 += num;
    }
    else if (num == 10) {
        string2 += num;
    }
    else {
        string2 += `${num}, `;
    }
}
console.log(string1);
console.log(string2);
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

// Your code goes here
```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js

let num = 1;
let sum = 0;
while (num <= 20) {
    sum += num;
    num++;
}
console.log(sum);

// Your code goes here
```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
let num = 1;
while (num <= 20) {
    if(num % 2 == 0) {
        console.log(num);
    }
    num++;
}
// Your code goes here
```
